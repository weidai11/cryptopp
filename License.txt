The Crypto++ Library uses portions of Andy Polyakov's CRYPTOGAMS on Linux
for 32-bit ARM with files aes_armv4.S, sha1_armv4.S and sha256_armv4.S.
CRYPTOGAMS is dual licensed with a permissive BSD-style license. The
CRYPTOGAMS license is reproduced below. You can disable Cryptogams code by
undefining the relevant macros in config_asm.h.

The Crypto++ Library uses portions of Jack Lloyd's Botan for ChaCha SSE2 and
AVX. Botan placed the code in public domain for Crypto++ to use.

The Crypto++ Library (as a compilation) is currently licensed under the Boost
Software License 1.0 (http://www.boost.org/users/license.html).
