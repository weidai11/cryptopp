 * curve25519-donna: Curve25519 elliptic curve, public key function
 *
 * http://code.google.com/p/curve25519-donna/
 *
 * Adam Langley <agl@imperialviolet.org>
 *
 * Derived from public domain C code by Daniel J. Bernstein <djb@cr.yp.to>
 *
 * More information about curve25519 can be found here
 *   http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html
 *
 * djb's sample implementation of curve25519 is written in a special assembly
 * language called qhasm and uses the floating point registers.
 *
 * This is, almost, a clean room reimplementation from the curve25519 paper. It
 * uses many of the tricks described therein. Only the crecip function is taken
 * from the sample implementation. */
