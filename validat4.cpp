// validat4.cpp - written and placed in the public domain by Jeffrey Walton
//                Routines in this source file test NaCl library routines.
//
//    There are two types or sets of self tests. First is a known answer test,
//    and second are pairwise consitency checks. The known answer tests are test
//    vectors lifted from libsodium. The pairwise consitency checks are randomized
//    and confirm the library can arrive at the same result or round trip data
//    using it's own transformations.
//
//    A link like https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/master/test/default/box.c
//    references the libsodium test data for a test. For example, box.c is one of the
//    test runners for crypto_box, and there is a box.exp with the known answer. The
//    glue code for box.c and box.exp is in "cmptest.h". box.c runs the test and
//    generates output, while cmptest.h gathers the output and compares them.
